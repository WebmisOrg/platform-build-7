NOTE

Since WSO2 ESB Analytics will be included in the WSO2 Integrator(http://wso2.com/integration) as the Analytics profile, we are deprecating this product and moving it to the attic.

WSO2 ESB Analytics

WSO2 ESB Analytics provides capabilities to monitor the services which are deployed in the WSO2 ESB. It provides the ability to monitor statistics of top level components like SOAP services (Proxy), REST services (API) and second level components like inbound endpoints, sequences, endpoints and the atomic level components of mediators. WSO2 ESB analytics is powered by the WSO2 Data Analytics Server (DAS).
